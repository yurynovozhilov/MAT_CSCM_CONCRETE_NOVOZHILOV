# MAT_CSCM_CONCRETE_NOVOZHILOV

Continuous Surface Cap Model (CSCM) for concrete material behavior simulation.

**This code was developed during the research for the scientific article:**
*"Precise Calibration of the Continuous Surface Cap Model for Concrete Simulation"* published in Buildings journal (2022).

Launch the interactive Jupyter notebook directly in your browser without any installation!

### üîß Binder Environment
The online environment includes:
- Python 3.12 runtime with all dependencies
- Interactive widgets for parameter adjustment
- All experimental data files
- Automatic notebook launch (`cscm.ipynb`)

**First launch may take 5-10 minutes to build. Subsequent launches are much faster.**

For detailed Binder setup information, see [docs/BINDER_SETUP.md](docs/BINDER_SETUP.md).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Virtual Environment Activation
```bash
# Activate environment (required!)
source activate.sh
```

### Launch Main Notebook
```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
./run_jupyter.sh
```

### Module Testing
```bash
# Test all modules
python test_modules.py
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.12 (uses virtual environment `venv312`)
- All dependencies installed in `venv312`

## üîß VS Code Setup

VS Code is automatically configured to use the correct Python interpreter from `venv312`. Settings are located in `.vscode/settings.json`.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Main modules (Python 3 compatible):
- `CEB.py` - CEB-FIP model for concrete properties
- `CapModel.py` - CSCM yield surface model  
- `plotcurves.py` - Plotting utilities
- `d3py.py` - 3D visualization and CSCM generation functions
- `transformation.py` - Coordinate transformation utilities
- `cscm.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook

### Helper files:
- `activate.sh` - Environment activation script
- `run_jupyter.sh` - Jupyter launch script
- `test_modules.py` - Module testing script

### Archive files:
- `arc/` - Old code versions (Python 2, not used)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

**Always use the `venv312` virtual environment!**

All commands should be executed after environment activation:
```bash
source activate.sh
```

## üìä Compatibility Status

‚úÖ **Python 3.12** - Full compatibility  
‚úÖ **All main modules** - Tested and working  
‚úÖ **Jupyter Notebook** - Functions fixed, ready to use  
‚úÖ **VS Code** - Automatic interpreter selection configured
