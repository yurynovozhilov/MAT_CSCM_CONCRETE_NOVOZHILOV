# Collections Migration Report

## Summary
Successfully removed dependency on `collections.OrderedDict` from the MAT_CSCM_CONCRETE_NOVOZHILOV project.

## Background
In Python 3.7+, regular dictionaries (`dict`) maintain insertion order, making `OrderedDict` unnecessary for most use cases. Since the project uses Python 3.12.11, we can safely replace `OrderedDict` with regular `dict`.

## Changes Made

### Python Files Modified:
1. **CEB.py**
   - Removed: `from collections import OrderedDict as OD`
   - Changed: `data = OD()` → `data = {}`

2. **d3py.py**
   - Changed: `CSCM = OD()` → `CSCM = {}`

3. **test_binder.py**
   - Removed: `from collections import OrderedDict as OD`

4. **test_modules.py**
   - Removed: `('collections', None)` from modules_to_test

### Notebook Files Modified:
1. **cscm.ipynb**
   - Removed: `from collections import OrderedDict as OD`

2. **curves.ipynb**
   - Removed: `from collections import OrderedDict as OD`

### Files Not Modified:
- All files in `arc/` directory (archived versions)
- Other core modules (`CapModel.py`, `plotcurves.py`, `transformation.py`) - did not use OrderedDict

## Testing Results
- ✅ All module imports work correctly
- ✅ Basic functionality tests pass
- ✅ Notebook functions work properly
- ✅ CEB and CSCM functions return regular dict objects
- ✅ Dictionary order is preserved (Python 3.12.11 guarantee)

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Dependencies**: No longer depends on `collections.OrderedDict`
2. **Cleaner Code**: Uses built-in `dict` type
3. **Better Performance**: Regular dicts are slightly faster than OrderedDict
4. **Future Compatibility**: Aligns with modern Python practices

## Compatibility
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.7+ (project uses 3.12.11 ✅)
- **Functionality**: No breaking changes - all functions work identically
- **Data Structure**: Regular dict maintains insertion order in Python 3.7+

## Conclusion
The migration was successful with no functional changes. The project now uses standard Python dictionaries while maintaining all existing functionality.
